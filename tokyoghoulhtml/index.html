    <h2>
        About Ken Kaneki:
    </h2>
    <p class="maincharacter">
        Ken Kaneki, the protagonist of Tokyo Ghoul, begins as an ordinary, timid college student who loves reading. His life changes drastically after a near-fatal encounter with a ghoul, resulting in an organ transplant that turns him into a half-ghoul. This transformation forces him into the violent and morally complex world of ghouls, creatures who survive by eating human flesh. Kaneki struggles with his dual identity, trying to maintain his humanity while coping with his ghoul instincts. Early on, he is naive and hesitant, often avoiding confrontation and seeking safety, but the constant threat from both ghouls and humans pushes him to grow in strength and resolve.

As the story progresses, Kaneki undergoes profound psychological and physical transformations. He experiences intense suffering and trauma, particularly at the hands of the sadistic ghoul Yakumo “Jason” Oomori, which shatters his previous timid personality. Through these trials, he becomes more assertive, strategic, and willing to embrace his ghoul nature to survive and protect those he cares about. Kaneki’s journey is defined by the balance between kindness and ruthlessness; he retains a core sense of empathy even as he is forced to commit brutal acts. By the end of Tokyo Ghoul, Kaneki has evolved into a complex, resilient individual who embodies both the fragility and strength of human and ghoul existence.
